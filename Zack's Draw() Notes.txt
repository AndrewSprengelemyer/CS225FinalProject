Draw function (basically) (assuming using an array) (see lecture 6 slides)

Possible function to use in print():

Able to rework this based on the size of the array?? Like using length(), .size, or strlen() or something? 

void printArray(const int* list, int size){  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)    cout << list[i] << " ";} 

 

 

For Zack: 

Random note: don’t forget the “break;” statements in any of the switch code blocks 

Random note 2: gameState and player.state are ENUMs. Forgot the word.
